        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple" style="margin-top: 0px">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>I learnt that once I see a way of potentially solving a problem, I tend to be quite stubborn in trying to make that method work. So I need to step back more often to see if there’s a better approach.</li>
          <li>I learnt that I revert to a fixed mindset quite often, so now when I feel stuck I consider if it’s just my fixed mindset speaking so that I can switch to a growth mindset.</li>
          <li>I learned that my ego makes me very hesitant to ask for help via chat, knowing my question will sit there for everyone to see. Whereas in person I’m quite happy to ask for help.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
          I think its good to be self-aware in order to understand where you may be blocking yourself. Once you’re aware, then it’s a lot easier to fix. Knowing my values also helps me understand what’s subconsciously driving me. And being empathic, both to myself and others, helps create a safe space to fail, which is important for learning.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I was surprised how helpful it was, even though I already felt familiar with many of the topics. It helped me realise things about myself that I hadn’t noticed before.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          The topic of identity and values felt very confronting, so that was challenging for me.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
          Personality and motivations play a huge part in one’s work life (at least from my experience) so it makes sense that we reflect on these and figure out how we want to improve in order to increase our chances of success at interviews & work.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h2>
        <p>
          It was quite easy to get through the Core material (in contrast to Tech) so it didn’t feel like too much time was taken away. And the benefits for me were worth it - I hadn’t realised how often I slipped into a fixed mindset, and the Core work helped me identify this.
