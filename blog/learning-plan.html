        <h2 class="h2-default">Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3 class="h3-default">What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          I'm mainly using this course to determine if I'd prefer the development side of websites rather than the design side (I'm currently a user experience designer that mocks up high-fidelity designs for developers to implement). Currently I see four potential outcomes:
          <ol>
            <li>I realise I still prefer the design-side, but use my knowledge of code to improve hand-off with the developers I work with, and also to inform my work on design systems.</li>
            <li>I realise I prefer coding, and transition into a developer role at my current work.</li>
            <li>I realise I prefer coding, but a specific subset, so I look specifically for a developer role that allows me to further upskill in the areas I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I realise I enjoy design and coding equally, so potentially work on side-projects that cover both skills (e.g. app building) until I can transition this into a full-time gig.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-default">What are my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Creating this website definitely highlighted some strengths and limitations I have when it comes to learning: mainly that I can come up with the concept I want to create fairly quickly but, if this takes longer than the recommended time to implement, I find it extremely hard to adjust the vision I have (very all-or-nothing!). So to overcome this, I want to be more diligent in sticking to the suggested timeframes by splitting each timeframe into two, and using that halfway point to reassess and adjust my gameplan when needed.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-default">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>
          I want to be a lot more proactive, both in socialising with others in the chat & in-person, as well as proactively upskilling myself. Daily reflection will help with this, as I can identify the specific ways I can be more proactive.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-default">How will I manage my workload in this programme?</h3>
        <p>
          I want to stick to a daily routine so that I have a good work/life balance, as by improving my wellbeing I expect my ability to manage the workload will also improve. Additionally I want to stick to the suggested timeframes and also look ahead to what's coming, as I so far I've tended to spend too much time on certain tasks at the expense of other priorities.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-default">How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h3>
        <p>
          When I get stuck, this is current steps I go through until I'm unstuck:
          <ol>
            <li>Ask Google.</li>
            <li>Ask ChatGPT.</li>
            <li>Ask my family (if non-technical).</li>
            <li>Ask others from my homegroup.</li>
            <li>Ask in the relevant Dev Academy Discord forum.</lit>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-default">What do I expect from the Facilitation team?</h3>
        <p>
          Relevant guidance when needed :&rpar;
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3-default">How have I scheduled my study time vs blocked-out time?</h3>
        <p>
          I've used my Google Calandar to timeblock out each day, ensuring I'm getting in enough study time as well as maintaining my wellbeing.
