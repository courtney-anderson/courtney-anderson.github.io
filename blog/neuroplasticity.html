        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple" style="margin-top: 0px">What is neuroplasticity and how can I utilise it?</h2>
        <p>
          When you learn or do things, your brain creates a “pathway” for how to remember or do that thing. Like walking through long grass, the more times you repeat or recall that thing, the more defined that specific pathway becomes. If you stop using this pathway however, eventually the grass will grow over. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Pathways also build off of existing pathways, meaning knowledge is always built upon existing knowledge. And the more connections a pathway has, the more likely it is to be retained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing that our brains work in this way is beneficial because we can be intentional in building pathways to the knowledge we want to obtain and the habits we want to build. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To increase my neuroplasticity then, I would continuously repeat the things I want to get better at (e.g. running, touch-typing, new habits), continue to use the knowledge I want to retain, and learn by building off the concepts I already understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          A resource I’d recommend related to this is Maxell Maltz’ book <i>Psycho-Cybernetics</i>, which teaches you how to utilise neuroplasticity to create a new self-identity.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">What is a growth mindset and how is this related to neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is recognising that anything can be learned; that you are not “fixed” in the way that you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          This goes hand-in-hand with neuroplasticity, as building new neural pathways is how you’d overcome the feeling of being stuck (a common symptom of a fixed mindset) either by utilising repetition or by building off the existing knowledge that you have.
        </p>
        <p>
          A related resource is Malcolm Gladwell’s book <i>Outliers</i>, where he shows “brilliance” is actually just time invested to build a skill, rather than something you’re born with.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">How will these understandings influence my learning strategy?</h2>
        <p>
          Knowing that I am capable of change, and that it’s practically guaranteed, will help me persevere during the moments when I feel stuck, rather than resorting to procrastination. So I’ll be aiming for enthusiastic curiosity, rather than anxiety!
