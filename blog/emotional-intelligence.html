        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple" style="margin-top: 0px">What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise and moderate your own emotions, as well as understand and empathise with other people’s emotions. This concept was popularised by psychologist David Goleman, who identified five key traits of someone with high emotional intelligence: that they are self-aware, self-regulated, self-motivated, empathetic towards others, and have good social skills.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ (Emotional Quotient) measures emotional intelligence, while IQ (Intelligence Quotient) measures intellectual capacity. IQ is seen to be more fixed, whereas someone’s EQ can be improved through experiences, reflection, and practice.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          Having a high EQ usually indicates that you’ll have better wellbeing, as you’ll typically have healthy relationships with others and with yourself. This then has a positive impact on the various areas of your life, such as work, family, and personal growth. You’re also more likely to have low stress, less conflict, and be adaptable to change.
