        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple" style="margin-top: 0px">What's an analogy for the relationship between JavaScript, HTML & CSS?</h2>
          <!-- An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. -->
        <p>
          HTML is like the bullet points of a story; a basic outline from start to finish. CSS is the world-building and character-building, which gives the story it's unique setting. And then JavaScript fleshes out these two to create the finished novel, where the reader is brought into the story that then logically unfolds before their eyes.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">What are loops and control flows?</h2>
          <!-- Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those). -->
          <p>
          "Loops" and "control flows" can often be seen in step-by-step processes. To explain each of these, let's imagine a how-to guide for cleaning a house. A "loop" would be a step (or steps) that repeated itself until completed, for example: vacuum the hallway, vacuum the living room, vacuum the bedroom, etc, until all rooms are vacuumed. And a "control flow" would be a step (or steps) that was conditional, for example: if you have a bath, follow these cleaning steps; if you have a shower, follow these cleaning steps, or skip these steps if they don't apply.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">What is the DOM and how would someone interact with it?</h2>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) takes all the elements of a webpage and represents their relationship to one-another through a hierarchical, tree-like structure. By identifying each element in this way, a "map" is created of the entire page, enabling specific elements to be targeted. One way of interacting with the DOM is through JavaScript, where the DOM's structure can be called upon to target, view and/or modify these elements.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">What's the difference between accessing data from arrays verses objects?</h2>
        <p>
          Because an array is an "ordered collection", data can be accessed by referring to the data's location in the array. In contrast, an object is unordered, so the data is instead called upon by referencing the property of the object you're looking to retrieve.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">What are functions and why are they helpful?</h2>
        <p>
          A function is a way to save a task performed in code, which can be triggered by calling on the function's name. This is helpful because the function can then be repeatedly called upon, rather than the code itself needing to be continuously written.
