          I noticed with the JavaScript Kata exercises that once they were solved the answers often seemed simple in hindsight. When trying to solve them though, I frequently felt stuck, constantly confused as to why I wasn't getting the expected outputs. I found that breaking down the problems into smaller chunks was a massive help, as I could console.log each output as I progressed and it was easier to find resources online for the smaller chunks I was trying to solve. These smaller wins also became motivation to push through the rest of each exercise. So the main takeaway for me was that when I feel stuck, it's probably a good time to breakdown the problem further and aim for the smaller wins.

          When I was doing the HTML & CSS for this site, I really wanted to use a grid pattern as the background fill for some sections (such as the purple section on this page). When I googled this initially, it seemed that this might only be possible with JavaScript, if my intention was to generate a certain number of grid lines based on the dimensions of a div. As we hadn't learnt JavaScript yet, I reconsidered my approach, and tiled an image I created of grid lines instead. Realising that an SVG might be better, I reconsidered my approach again, and after further googling I was able get the tiling happening within the SVG itself which was then referenced in a CSS class, meaning I could easily apply a grid effect to any div using this class. This taught me that if the potential solution seems super complicated, I may just be over-thinking it!

            <td>I really appreciate the existing pseudocode in the exercises we've been given but I don't often write my own pseudocode, so I'm keen to build this habit especially as tasks become more complex.</td>

          <tr>
            <th>Trying something</th>
            <td>I'm good at making an initial attempt, I just need to work on maintaining that enthusiasm with all the attempts that come after (as opposed to wallowing in the feeling that I'm stuck).</td>

            <th>Asking your peers for help</th>
            <td>When I've caught up with other classmates in person, this is when I've asked for help, as it's usually the quickest way to get a good answer! Otherwise if I'm by myself, I just use Google or ChatGPT.</td>

            <td>I'm not reflecting as much as I want to be, as sometimes I just want to move on if I've spent a lot of time on something, so I'd like to prioritise this more - maybe by getting the work done earlier so that I have more time to reflect.</td>

        <!-- Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time? -->
          When I feel stuck, I usually don't want to ask for help, as I feel embarrassed to be stuck in the first place! Thankfully the emphasis this course put on having a growth mindset reminds me that being stuck is simply an opportunity to get unstuck, and not a fixed state. And I've also been seeing how beneficial it is for others who ask for help in the chat, so I think this is slowly giving me confidence to do the same.
