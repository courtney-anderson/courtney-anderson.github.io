        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple" style="margin-top: 0px">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
        <p>
          When I think about ethical decisions that I’ve made in my life, it’s definitely the ones from my childhood that stand out the most, probably because they were foundational in teaching me what a good set of morals actually looks like!
        </p>
        <p>
          One experience I remember vividly happened at primary school when I was six. Our teacher kept a box of Froot Loops cereal in her classroom, which she’d distribute every so often as a reward for completing activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          One lunch time I wandered past the classroom to find a classmate happily eating several handfuls. I was surprised to find her like that, but she offered me a Froot Loop which I ate before I promptly retreated back outside.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Seeing a teacher out in the courtyard who was on lunchtime supervision, I was suddenly overcome with a strong feeling of moral obligation to alert her to what was happening in the classroom, pointing her to the crime scene. And walking away, I felt a sense of achievement; that I had righted a wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later however, another classmate ran after me, telling me to go to the classroom and adding an ominous, “You’re in trouble!” My six-year-old brain was very confused, thinking, “But I did the right thing, what could I possibly be in trouble for?”
        </p>
        <p>
          However, arriving at the classroom, it was pointed out to me that I too had partaken in the offence. It didn’t matter that my classmate had eaten handfuls and I had only eaten one, nor that she had been the instigator and I the follower: we’d both committed the crime and so were both issued a detention.
        </p>
        <p>
          In hindsight, I look at this fondly, as it taught me a good lesson that rather than taking the perceived moral high-ground, I needed to be judging myself before I even considered judging others. As summarised by Earl Nightingale: “When you judge others, you do not define them, you define yourself.”
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>
          On reflection, I think my friends & family have had the biggest impact on my values, while my schooling had the biggest impact on my identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can see many of my core values in my parents, younger sister, and childhood friends, so I feel very lucky to have grown up around people that I’d still want to emulate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In regards to my identity, I attended the same school for all of my schooling (Year 1-13), so growing up with the same group of kids for thirteen years definitely impacted how I saw myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In primary school, there was an emphasis on “gifted kids” who would get extra stuff to learn during lessons, and who would get to attend a special class each week to learn more about general knowledge topics. I ended up in this group, and because we were always learning extra material, this kept us ahead of most of our peers and we did well on tests without having to try that hard. I ended up winning the top academic cups in both primary and middle school, and so my identity was very much “I am gifted so don’t need to try”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cue the rude awakening in high school, when suddenly all of our subjects were teaching brand new information that I hadn’t learnt the year before. My peers expected to hear that I was continuing to ace all of my classes but, because I didn’t have a habit of studying, this was no longer the case. I definitely had a “fixed mindset” at the time, so hearing a lot of people express their disappointment in me and not knowing how to get back to a good academic level made me quite withdrawn and self-conscious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately when I went to uni I learned about having a growth mindset, meaning I no longer had to hold my failures as part of my identity. Over a decade later, I do sometimes slip into that old fixed way of thinking, but overall I’m a lot happier now knowing that my identity isn’t static and can be nurtured into something I’m proud of.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
        <p>
          I love creating things and problem-solving, which will be great drivers when it comes to learning to code, especially as I find it easy to work towards something when I can visualise what I want the outcome to be (to the point that I can be quite tunnel-visioned about it!). I also like admin-related things such as planning, note-taking, and researching, which I expect will help with my learning journey.
          <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve mainly worked as a user experience designer, meaning I’ve designed webpages or site enhancements that have then been handed over to developers to create. To finally learn how the implementation works then will be quite humbling for me I think! I probably have a lot of preconceived notions about how code works, so hopefully I can correct or validate these during the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to the course, I wasn’t able to commit much time to learning code, so I think I’ll be behind a lot of my classmates in terms of my skill-level. So I’m aiming to work hard before bootcamp starts so that I can get to a similar level as others as efficiently as possible.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-blog-multiple">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
        <p>
          I once worked as a user experience designer in a team that managed a company’s website. The company also had a marketing team who would occasionally update the site for marketing purposes. My team was driven to create the best user-experience, while the marketing team was driven to sell more products. As you can imagine, this often caused tension!
        </p>
        <p>
          My initial strategy was to discuss my concerns with my teammates, however this was leaning into an us-verses-them mindset, which was not effective in resolving tension at all. The break-though came when I realised I could work side-by-side with someone from marketing, because as it turns out, when you have open communication and create something together you can land on solutions a lot more easily and amicably… so much so that I ended up with friends from the marketing team!
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this taught me that it’s best to be proactive in aligning with and accommodating others, which will usually create a better outcome for everyone.
